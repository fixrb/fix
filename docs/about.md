## About Fix

Fix is a modern Ruby testing framework conceived with a fundamental architectural principle: strict separation between specifications and their implementation. This unique approach allows developers to write clearer, more maintainable tests while providing solid guarantees about their code's behavior.

### Philosophy

Fix was born from a simple observation: testing frameworks shouldn't be more complex than the code they test. Built with minimalism in mind and powered by modular components (Defi, Matchi, Spectus), Fix brings clarity and joy to Ruby testing.

### Key Components

- **[Defi](https://github.com/fixrb/defi)**: Method handling abstraction
- **[Matchi](https://github.com/fixrb/matchi)**: Collection of expectation matchers
- **[Spectus](https://github.com/fixrb/spectus)**: Test runner with RFC 2119 semantics

### Project History

Originally released in 2015, Fix was created to address the growing complexity in Ruby testing frameworks. The project has evolved while maintaining its core principle: making testing both rigorous and enjoyable.
